The Other Two Projects , **3 Whistle** and **File Store** are old projects {like 2 - 3 yrs ago} and they use simple "setState" State Management and no architecture since they were simple quick freelance projects

Unfortunately i've lost access to **Chillito** and **Wearina** source codes since last year my hard drive got damaged and could never repair it. 

**File Store App** , is a wordpress client app that connects to a WP website of your choice,  using WP-API-Key and it can fetch all the articles and data published on that website

this app is most suitable for those who have paid content on their website and they want their content to be used only using this app and by the one who has paid for it , not anyone else and not anywhere else , 
just by you and only in this app.

you can navigate through pages and see the content of the website , right on your app.  

> If an item has a price , you can pay for that , and after payment , the app automatically finds the content {be : Music , Video Or PDF} , Downloads them all , **Encrypts** and **organizes** them in their specific folder {Whis is hidden and can be found no where in your phone} and Then you can view the downloaded items.

not to forget that this app has **built-in Video / Audio Player** and **PDF reader.**
